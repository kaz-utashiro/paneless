# NAME

	paneless - multipane pager

![GUI](https://github.com/nkh/paneless/blob/main/media/paneless.png)

# SYNOPSIS

	paneless [-t -a -l -L] file <(seq 5) file ...

# DESCRIPTION

***paneless*** reads its input stream from its arguments (no piping), format them to fit the terminal, and colors them.

Processing multiple large inputs may take time to process, so does input that contains ANSI color codes. 

Once processed vertical scrolling is fast; horizontal scrolling re-processes all the inputs.
